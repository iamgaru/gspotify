# Assets Directory

This directory contains static assets used by the application, such as images, icons, and other media files.

## Example Images

Here are some example images that demonstrate the application's functionality:

- `gs-gopher.png`: The application's mascot/logo
- `dubstep-playlist-search.png`: Example of playlist search functionality
- `quick-play.png`: Demonstration of quick play feature
- `multiple-players.png`: Showcase of multiple player support

## Directory Structure

- `images/`: Contains image files used in the application
  - `gs-gopher.png`: The application's mascot/logo
  - `dubstep-playlist-search.png`: Example of playlist search functionality
  - `quick-play.png`: Demonstration of quick play feature
  - `multiple-players.png`: Showcase of multiple player support

## Usage

When adding new assets:
1. Place image files in the `images/` directory
2. Use relative paths from the project root when referencing these assets in code
3. Keep file sizes optimized for performance
4. Use appropriate file formats (PNG for images with transparency, JPG for photos, SVG for scalable graphics)

## Best Practices

- Optimize images for web use
- Use descriptive filenames
- Maintain consistent naming conventions
- Document any new assets added
